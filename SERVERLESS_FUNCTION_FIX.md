# Serverless Function Fix Summary

## Problem
The Vercel deployment was failing with error:
```
500: INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
Code: FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED
ID: sin1::4kx9v-1759707297892-e7b7d2524a9f
```

## Root Cause
The recent deployment changes upgraded the Python version to 3.12, but Vercel's serverless Python runtime does not yet have full support for Python 3.12. This caused the function to fail during invocation.

## Changes Applied

### 1. Added `runtime.txt`
**File**: `runtime.txt` (new file)
**Content**: `python-3.11`

**Why**: Explicitly tells Vercel which Python version to use. Vercel has stable support for Python 3.9 and 3.11, but 3.12 support is still limited.

### 2. Updated `.python-version`
**File**: `.python-version`
**Change**: `3.12` → `3.11`

**Why**: Ensures consistency across development and production environments.

### 3. Updated `pyproject.toml`
**File**: `pyproject.toml`
**Changes**:
- `requires-python = ">=3.12"` → `requires-python = ">=3.11"`
- `target-version = ["py312"]` → `target-version = ["py311"]`

**Why**: Aligns project requirements with supported Python version.

### 4. Enhanced `vercel.json`
**File**: `vercel.json`
**Added**:
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "api/index.py": {
      "runtime": "python3.11",
      "maxDuration": 10
    }
  },
  "rewrites": [...]
}
```

**Why**: Explicitly specifies the Python runtime for the serverless function, removing any ambiguity in Vercel's auto-detection.

### 5. Improved Error Handling in `config.py`
**File**: `src/app/core/config.py`
**Change**: Enhanced the `get_settings()` function to gracefully handle missing .env files and provide better error messages.

**Why**: Makes the application more resilient to missing environment variables during cold starts and provides clearer error messages for debugging.

### 6. Updated Documentation
**File**: `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md`
**Changes**: 
- Updated Python version references to 3.11
- Enhanced troubleshooting section with specific solutions for FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED errors

## How to Deploy

1. **Ensure all changes are committed**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: Downgrade to Python 3.11 for Vercel compatibility"
   git push
   ```

2. **Redeploy to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Verify the deployment**:
   - Check that the function starts successfully
   - Visit the `/health` endpoint to verify the app is running
   - Check Vercel logs for any errors

## Testing Locally

To verify the changes work locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies with Python 3.11
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Expected Outcome

After these changes:
- ✅ The serverless function should start successfully
- ✅ No more FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED errors
- ✅ The application should be accessible at your Vercel URL
- ✅ The `/health` endpoint should return `{"status": "healthy"}`

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in your Vercel project:
- `SESSION_SECRET` (minimum 32 characters)
- `SUPABASE_URL` (optional, but recommended)
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (optional, but recommended)
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (optional, but recommended)
- `ENVIRONMENT=production` (optional)

The application will start without Supabase credentials, but some features will be limited.
