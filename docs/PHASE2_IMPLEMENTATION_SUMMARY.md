## Overview

Phase 2 focuses on implementing the core shopping and checkout functionality for Sensasiwangi.id MVP. This phase enables customers to browse products, add items to cart, and complete purchases through a streamlined checkout flow.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. ✅ Order Service (Already Existed)
**File**: `src/app/services/orders.py`

The Order Service was already fully implemented with:
- ✓ Create orders with items and shipping address
- ✓ Order status management (draft → paid → shipped → completed)
- ✓ Payment status tracking
- ✓ Inventory reservation and release
- ✓ Order history logging
- ✓ Stock validation before order creation
- ✓ Automatic order number generation

**Key Methods**:
- `create_order()` - Create new order from cart items
- `update_order_status()` - Update order lifecycle status
- `get_order()` - Retrieve order with all details
- `list_customer_orders()` - Get customer's order history

### 2. ✅ Cart Service (Already Existed)
**File**: `src/app/services/cart.py`

Session-based shopping cart with:
- ✓ Add/remove/update items
- ✓ Cart total calculation
- ✓ Session persistence
- ✓ Clear cart after checkout

**Key Methods**:
- `add_item()` - Add product to cart
- `remove_item()` - Remove product from cart
- `update_quantity()` - Change item quantity
- `get_cart()` - Get cart summary with totals
- `clear_cart()` - Empty the cart

### 3. ✅ Checkout Routes (NEW)
**File**: `src/app/api/routes/checkout.py`

New checkout flow implementation:

#### Routes Created:
- `GET /checkout` - Display checkout page with shipping form
- `POST /api/checkout/create-order` - Process order creation
- `GET /order/confirmation/{order_id}` - Show order confirmation

### 5. ✅ Database Migration (NEW)
**File**: `supabase/migrations/0004_order_helpers.sql`

#### Functions Created:
- `reserve_stock(product_id, quantity)` - Atomically reserve inventory
  - Locks row to prevent race conditions
  - Validates stock availability
  - Updates stock_reserved field
  
- `release_stock(product_id, quantity)` - Release reserved inventory
  - Used when orders are cancelled
  - Decrements stock_reserved
  
- `commit_stock(product_id, quantity)` - Commit sale
  - Reduces both on_hand and reserved
  - Called when order is fulfilled

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
Customer Journey:
1. Browse Marketplace → Add to Cart (session storage)
2. View Cart → Click Checkout
3. Fill Shipping Form → Submit
4. Order Service validates stock
5. Reserve inventory atomically
6. Create order record
7. Clear cart session
8. Redirect to confirmation page

Order Lifecycle:
draft → awaiting_payment → paid → processing → shipped → completed
                ↓
            cancelled (releases inventory)
```

### Database Schema (Already Existed)

Tables used by Phase 2:
- `orders` - Main order records
- `order_items` - Line items per order
- `order_shipping_addresses` - Delivery addresses
- `order_status_history` - Audit trail
- `marketplace_listings` - Product availability
- `marketplace_inventory_adjustments` - Stock changes

### Session Management

Cart data stored in session:
```json
{
  "shopping_cart": [
    {
      "product_id": "uuid",
      "product_name": "Rimba Embun",
      "brand_name": "Nusantarum",
      "unit_price": 420000,
      "quantity": 2,
      "image_url": "...",
      "variant_id": null
    }
  ]
}
```

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations:
1. **Guest Checkout**: Requires user authentication (can be relaxed)
2. **Shipping Cost**: Not calculated (shows "Akan dihitung")
3. **Payment Integration**: Manual confirmation only
4. **Email Notifications**: Not implemented yet
5. **Order Cancellation UI**: No customer-facing cancel button

### Roadmap (Phase 3+):
- [ ] RajaOngkir integration for shipping costs
- [ ] Payment gateway integration (Midtrans)
- [ ] Automated email notifications
- [ ] Order cancellation flow for customers
- [ ] Order tracking with courier API
- [ ] Invoice generation (PDF)
- [ ] Return/refund workflow

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables Required:
```bash
# Already configured in Phase 1
SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGc...

# Session configuration
SESSION_SECRET_KEY=<secure-random-key>
```

### Migration Steps:
1. ✅ Apply database migration: `0004_order_helpers.sql`
2. ✅ Restart application to load new routes
3. ✅ Verify Supabase connection
4. ✅ Test checkout flow in staging

### Rollback Plan:
If issues arise:
1. Remove checkout routes from `application.py`
2. Drop functions from migration 0004
3. Revert to cart-only flow

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented:
- ✓ Session-based cart (no DB writes until checkout)
- ✓ Atomic stock operations (no deadlocks)
- ✓ Indexed queries on order tables
- ✓ Minimal template rendering
- ✓ Rate limiting prevents abuse

### Monitoring Recommendations:

## Success Metrics (Phase 2)

### Technical Metrics:
- ✅ All checkout routes implemented
